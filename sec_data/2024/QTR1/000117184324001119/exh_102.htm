to the manufacturing of Product, (iii)&nbsp;are free and clear of all liens or encumbrances; and (iv)&nbsp;are not adulterated as defined
under Title 21 - FOOD AND DRUGS: CHAPTER 9 - FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT: SUBCHAPTER V - DRUGS AND DEVICES: Part A - Drugs and
Devices: Sec. 351 - Adulterated drugs and devices. However, AMSINO shall not be responsible in the event adulteration was caused by adulterated
Raw Materials provided by UNITED. AMSINO further warrants to UNITED that through the expiration date of this Agreement, Product: (I) will
be free from any defects in material and workmanship, and (II) will not fail to meet Specifications for a reason that is attributable
to any deviations by AMSINO from cGMP. AMSINO acknowledges that the properties of the plastic bottle are such that they may be subject
to change based upon heat, cold and method of packaging, freight and handling. Due to the uncertainty of these variables, AMSINO agrees
to use commercially reasonable efforts in preparing Product for shipment. To the extent that a claim is made that Product fails to comply
with the Specifications and such claim is related solely to a deformity or defect in the Product that may be environmentally related,
it shall be UNITED&rsquo;s obligation to show that the carrier stored and transported Product in accordance with the environmental parameters.
AMSINO&rsquo;s sole obligation and UNITED's exclusive remedy for any breach of the warranty in this Section 7.1 will be replacement of
the defective Product or at UNITED&rsquo;s sole option, instead of Product replacement, UNITED may request that AMSINO provide a refund
or credit for the price of the defective Product and AMSINO will provide said refund or credit for the price of the defective Product
to UNITED.</TD></TR>
