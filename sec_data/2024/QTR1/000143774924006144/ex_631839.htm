The proxy and power of attorney granted by TGTX pursuant to this Section 8.2.7 are coupled with an interest, are given to secure the performance of TGTX&#8217;s duties under this Agreement and will be irrevocable until the third (3<sup style="vertical-align:top;line-height:120%;">rd</sup>) anniversary following the Effective Date. The proxy and power of attorney will survive any merger, consolidation, conversion or reorganization of TGTX or any other entity holding any voting securities of Precision (other than any securities sold by TGTX to a Third Party in compliance with Section 8.2.6). For the avoidance of doubt, the proxy granted by this Section 8.2.7 shall not apply to any Extraordinary Matter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this Section 8.2.7 shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect upon the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.</p>
