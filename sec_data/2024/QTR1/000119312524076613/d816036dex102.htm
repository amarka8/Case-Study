the Placement Agent Information; and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim as such expenses are incurred. As used in this

failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have under the preceding paragraphs of this Section&nbsp;7 except to the extent that it has been materially prejudiced (through the forfeiture of
substantive rights or defenses) by such failure; and provided further that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability that it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under the preceding paragraphs of
this Section&nbsp;7. In case any such action shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent

such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation. No indemnifying party shall, without the written consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or threatened action or claim in respect
of which indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement, compromise or judgment (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) <I>Contribution.</I> If the indemnification provided for in this Section&nbsp;7 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party under subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents
on the other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the Placement Agents on the other
shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the total placement agent discounts and commissions received by the Placement Agents, in each case
as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state
a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the one hand or the Placement Agents on the other and the parties&#146; relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or
omission. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(e) <I>Limitation on Liability.</I> The Company and the Placement Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to paragraph (d)&nbsp;above were determined by <U>pro</U> <U>rata</U> allocation (even if the Placement Agents were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does not take account of the
equitable considerations referred to in paragraph (d)&nbsp;above. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) referred to in paragraph (d)&nbsp;above
shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions
of paragraphs (d)&nbsp;and (e), in no event shall a Placement Agent be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Securities placed by them were offered to the Investors exceeds the amount of any
damages that such Placement Agent has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. </P>
