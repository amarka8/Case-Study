For all other disputes within the scope of subpart (i), the parties will submit the dispute, within 30 business days following service of notice of such dispute by one party on the other, to AAA for prompt resolution in Salt Lake City, Utah, also under AAA rules for employment disputes. In either case, there shall be a single arbitrator, chosen in accordance with AAA rules, who at such time shall be on AAA&#8217;s Judicial Panel. If there are no AAA arbitrators in the applicable State, another arbitrator shall be selected from that State or a neighboring State, but the arbitration will still be conducted in the State in which your employment with the Company is based. The decision of the arbitrator will be final and binding upon the parties, and judgment may be entered thereon in accordance with applicable law in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator shall have the authority to make an award of monetary damages and interest thereon. The arbitrator shall have no authority to award, and the parties hereby waive any right to seek or receive, specific performance or an injunction, punitive or exemplary damages, except that the arbitrator shall have authority to issue injunctive relief to enforce the covenants in Sections 7 and 9, to the extent those covenants apply in the State in which your employment with the Company is based. The arbitrator will have no authority to order a modification or amendment of these Standard Terms and Conditions, except that if the arbitrator finds any covenant in Sections 7 and 9 of this agreement to be unenforceable as written, the arbitrator shall deem the agreement amended in order to give each such covenant its maximum effect, to the extent permitted by law in the State in which your employment with the Company is based. The arbitrator shall have the authority to award costs of arbitration, including reasonable attorney&#8217;s fees, to the prevailing party, but in the absence of such award the parties shall bear their own attorney and filing fees unless otherwise agreed upon mutually by the parties or required by law. The Company shall bear the cost of the arbitrator&#8217;s fees.</p>
