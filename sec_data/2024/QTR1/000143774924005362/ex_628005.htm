The Company hereby reserves the right to amend, modify, restate, supplement or terminate the Plan without the consent of Employee, so long as such amendment, modification, restatement or supplement does not materially reduce the rights and benefits available to Employee hereunder, and this Award will be subject, without further action by the Company or Employee, to such amendment, modification, restatement or supplement unless provided otherwise therein. The Company further reserves the right to amend, modify, restate, supplement or terminate the Plan and this Agreement without the consent of Employee in order to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or Company policy, including any law, regulation, or policy that could require forfeiture of this Award or cancellation of any stock issued pursuant to this Award.

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: normal; margin: 0pt; text-indent: 72pt; text-align: justify;">(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>No Transfer</u>.

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: normal; margin: 0pt; text-indent: 72pt; text-align: justify;">(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Mandatory Mediation and Arbitration Procedure</u>. By execution of this Agreement and acceptance of this Award, which is a voluntary benefit provided to the Employee by the Company, the Employee waives the Employee&#8217;s right to a jury trial in state or federal court and agrees that disputes arising under this Agreement must first be submitted for non-binding mediation before a neutral third party. If a dispute remains unresolved at the conclusion of the mediation process, either party may submit the dispute for resolution by final binding arbitration. The arbitrator shall have the authority to allow for appropriate discovery and exchange of information prior to a hearing, including (but not limited to) production of documents, information requests, depositions, and subpoenas. By execution of this Agreement, however, the Employee does not waive the Employee&#8217;s right to any normally available remedies the Employee may have in connection with any claim the Employee may bring against the Company, as an arbitrator can award any normal remedies the Employee could get in a court proceeding. By execution of this Agreement, the Employee represents that, to the extent the Employee considered necessary, the Employee has sought, at the Employee&#8217;s own expense, counsel regarding the terms of this Agreement and the waiver contemplated in this <u>Section 5(b)</u>. If this arbitration provision is found inapplicable, then either party may file suit and each party agrees that any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (or should such court lack jurisdiction to hear such action, suit or proceeding, in a Texas State court in Bexar County, Texas) and that the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of such court. The parties irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection a party may have to the laying of venue for any such suit, action or proceeding brought in such court. THE PARTIES ALSO EXPRESSLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT THEY HAVE OR MAY HAVE TO A JURY TRIAL OF ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING.</p>

The Company may require Employee to pay to the Company an amount the Company deems appropriate to satisfy its current or future obligation to withhold federal, state or local income or other taxes that you incur as a result of the Award. With respect to any required tax withholding, you may: (a) direct the Company to withhold from the Shares to be issued to you under this Agreement a sufficient number of Shares to satisfy such withholding, which determination will be based on the Shares&#8217; Fair Market Value at the time such determination is made; (b) deliver to the Company a number of Shares sufficient to satisfy such withholding, based on the Shares&#8217; Fair Market Value at the time such determination is made; (c) direct the Company to withhold from your wages or other cash compensation paid to you by the Company; or (d) deliver cash to the Company sufficient to satisfy such withholding obligations. If you desire to elect to use the stock withholding option described in subparagraph (a), you must make the election at the time and in the manner the Company prescribes. The Company, in its discretion, may deny your request to satisfy tax withholding using a method described under subparagraph (a) or (b). In the event the Company determines that the aggregate Fair Market Value of the Shares withheld as payment of any tax withholding is insufficient to discharge its tax withholding obligation, then you must pay to the Company, in cash, the amount of that deficiency immediately upon the Company&#8217;s request</p>
