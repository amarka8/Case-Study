The arbitrator shall have the authority to allow for appropriate discovery and exchange of information prior to a hearing, including (but not limited to) production of documents, information requests, depositions, and subpoenas. By execution of this Agreement, however, the Employee does not waive the Employee&#8217;s right to any normally available remedies the Employee may have in connection with any claim the Employee may bring against the Company, as an arbitrator can award any normal remedies the Employee could get in a court proceeding. By execution of this Agreement, the Employee represents that, to the extent the Employee considered necessary, the Employee has sought, at the Employee&#8217;s own expense, counsel regarding the terms of this Agreement and the waiver contemplated in this <u>Section 14</u>. If this arbitration provision is found inapplicable, then either party may file suit and each party agrees that any suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be brought in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas (or should such court lack jurisdiction to hear such action, suit or proceeding, in a Texas State court in Bexar County, Texas) and that the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of such court.

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: normal; margin: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; text-align: justify;">B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, in the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Administrator determines that an Other Covered Employee&#8217;s fraud or intentional misconduct directly related to such Accounting Restatement, then, unless otherwise determined by the Administrator in its discretion, any Erroneously Awarded Compensation received by such Other Covered Employee during the Applicable Period prior to the Accounting Restatement (i) that is then-outstanding but has not yet been paid shall be automatically and immediately forfeited and (ii) that has been paid to the Other Covered Employee shall be subject to reasonably prompt repayment to the Company.</p>

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: normal; margin: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; text-align: justify;">C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Administrator determines that any person shall repay any Erroneously Awarded Compensation pursuant to this Section V, the Administrator shall provide written notice to such person by email or certified mail to the physical address on file with the Company for such person, and the person shall satisfy such repayment in a manner and on such terms as required by the Administrator, and the Company shall be entitled to set off the repayment amount against any amount owed to the person by the Company, to require the forfeiture of any award granted by the Company to the person, or to take any and all necessary actions to reasonably promptly recoup the repayment amount from the person, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, including, without limitation, Section 409A of the Code. If the Administrator does not specify a repayment timing in the written notice described above, the applicable person shall be required to repay the Erroneously Awarded Compensation to the Company by wire, cash, or cashier&#8217;s check no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of such notice.</p>

<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size: 10pt; font-variant: normal; margin: 0pt; text-indent: 36pt; text-align: justify;">D.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may determine not to pursue the forfeiture and/or recovery of Erroneously Awarded Compensation from any Covered Individual if the Administrator determines that such forfeiture and/or recovery would be impracticable due to any of the following circumstances: (i) the direct expense paid to a third party to assist in enforcing the Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered (following reasonable attempts by the Company to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, the documentation of such attempts, and the provision of such documentation to the Nasdaq); or (ii) recovery would likely cause any otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees, to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 401(a)(13) or 411(a) of the Code.</p>
