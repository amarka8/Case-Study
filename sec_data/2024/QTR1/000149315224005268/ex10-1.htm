Company acknowledges and agrees that a Purchaser may from time to time pledge, and/or grant a security interest in, some or all of the
legended Securities in connection with applicable securities laws, pursuant to a bona fide margin agreement in compliance with a bona

pledgee, secured party or pledgor shall be required in connection with the pledge, but such legal opinion shall be required in connection
with a subsequent transfer or foreclosure following default by the Purchaser transferee of the pledge. No notice shall be required of
such pledge, but Purchaser&rsquo;s transferee shall promptly notify the Company of any such subsequent transfer or foreclosure. Each
Purchaser acknowledges that the Company shall not be responsible for any pledges relating to, or the grant of any security interest in,
any of the Securities or for any agreement, understanding or arrangement between any Purchaser and its pledgee or secured party. At the
appropriate Purchaser&rsquo;s expense, the Company will execute and deliver such reasonable documentation as a pledgee or secured party
of Securities may reasonably request in connection with a pledge or transfer of the Securities, including the preparation and filing
of any required prospectus supplement under Rule 424(b)(3) of the Securities Act or other applicable provision of the Securities Act

<U>Removal of Legends</U>. The legend set forth in <U>Section 4.1(b)</U> above shall be removed if (i) such Securities are registered
for resale under the Securities Act (provided that, if the Purchaser is selling pursuant to the effective registration statement registering
the Securities for resale, the Purchaser agrees to only sell such Securities during such time that such registration statement is effective
and not withdrawn or suspended, and only as permitted by such registration statement), (ii) such Securities are sold or transferred pursuant
to Rule 144 (if the transferor is not an Affiliate of the Company), or (iii) such Securities are eligible for resale under Rule 144(b)
or any successor provision, without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions. Following the earlier of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) Rule
144 becoming available for the resale of the Securities, without volume or manner-of-sale restrictions, the Company shall cause Company
Counsel to issue to the Transfer Agent the legal opinion referred to in the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions. Any fees (with respect
to the Transfer Agent, Company Counsel or otherwise) associated with the issuance of such opinion or the removal of such legend shall
be borne by the Company. Following the Effective Date, or at such earlier time as a legend is no longer required for the Securities,
if requested by a Purchaser, the Company shall request that the Transfer Agent remove any restrictive legends related to such Securities,
whether certificated or uncertificated, and issue a new, unlegended stock certificate or make a new, unlegended book entry for such Securities,

customary representations and other documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company and the Transfer Agent in connection therewith

Company represents and warrants that no instruction other than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions referred to in this <U>Section

in connection with <U>Section 4.1(c)</U>, and that such Securities shall otherwise be freely transferable on the books and records of
the Company as and to the extent provided in this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and applicable law. The Company acknowledges

Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its obligations under this <U>Section 4.1(d)</U> will be inadequate and agrees,
in the event of a breach or threatened breach by the Company of the provisions of this <U>Section 4.1(d)</U>, that a Purchaser shall

not sell or otherwise transfer the Securities or any interest therein without complying with the requirements of the Securities Act.
While the Registration Statement remains effective, each Purchaser hereunder may sell the Securities in accordance with the plan of distribution
contained in the Registration Statement and if it does so it will comply therewith and with the related prospectus delivery requirements
unless an exemption therefrom is available. Each Purchaser, severally and not jointly with the other Purchasers, agrees that if it is
notified by the Company in writing at any time that the Registration Statement registering the resale of the Securities is not effective
or that the prospectus included in such Registration Statement no longer complies with the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities
Act, the Purchaser will refrain from selling such Securities until such time as the Purchaser is notified by the Company that such Registration
Statement is effective or such prospectus is compliant with Section 10 of the Securities Act, unless such Purchaser is able to, and does,
sell such Securities pursuant to an available exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act. Both the

the reasonable fees and expenses of separate counsel (including local counsel) shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). It
shall be understood, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not, in connection with any one such Proceeding (including separate Proceedings
that have been or will be consolidated before a single judge) be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys
at any time for all Indemnified Parties, which firm shall be appointed by a majority of the Indemnified Parties. The Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending
Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified
Party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.</FONT></P>

<U>Independent Nature of Purchasers&rsquo; Obligations and Rights</U>. The obligations of each Purchaser under any Transaction Document
are several and not joint with the obligations of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance
of the obligations of any other Purchaser under any Transaction Document. The decision of each Purchaser to purchase Securities pursuant
to the Transaction Documents has been made by such Purchaser independently of any other Purchaser and independently of any information,
materials, statements or opinions as to the business, affairs, operations, assets, properties, liabilities, results of operations, condition
(financial or otherwise) or prospects of the Company or any Subsidiary which may have been made or given by any other Purchaser or by
any agent or employee of any other Purchaser, and no Purchaser and any of its agents or employees shall have any liability to any other
Purchaser (or any other Person) relating to or arising from any such information, materials, statement or opinions. Nothing contained
herein or in any Transaction Document, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant thereto, shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers
as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in any
way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents. Each
Purchaser acknowledges that no other Purchaser has acted as agent for such Purchaser in connection with making its investment hereunder
and that no Purchaser will be acting as agent of such Purchaser in connection with monitoring its investment in the Securities or enforcing
its rights under the Transaction Documents. Each Purchaser shall be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including
without limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other Transaction Documents, and it shall not be necessary
for any other Purchaser to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser has been represented by
its own separate legal counsel in its review and negotiation of the Transaction Documents. For reasons of administrative convenience
only, Purchasers and their respective counsels have chosen to communicate with the Company through Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP,
counsel to the Company. Each Purchaser acknowledges that Troutman Pepper Hamilton Sanders LLP has rendered legal advice to the Company
and not to such Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and that each such Purchaser has relied for such matters
on the advice of its own respective counsel.</FONT></P>

<U>Termination</U>. This Agreement may be terminated and the sale and purchase of the Securities abandoned at any time prior to the Closing

on or prior to 5:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Outside Date; <I>provided, however</I>, that the right to terminate this Agreement
under this <U>Section 7.17</U> shall not be available to any Person whose failure to comply with its obligations under this Agreement
has been the cause of or resulted in the failure of the Closing to occur on or before such time. Nothing in this <U>Section 7.17</U>
shall be deemed to release any party from any liability for any breach by such party of the terms and provisions of this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or to impair the right of any party to compel specific performance by any other party of its obligations
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents. In the event of a termination pursuant to this <U>Section 7.17</U>, the Company
shall promptly notify all non-terminating Purchasers. Upon a termination in accordance with this <U>Section 7.17</U>, the Company and
the terminating Purchaser(s) shall not have any further obligation or liability (including arising from such termination) to the other,
and no Purchaser will have any liability to any other Purchaser under the Transaction Documents as a result therefrom.</FONT></P>
